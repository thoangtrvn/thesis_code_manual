\begin{enumerate}
  \item .PIC : image data generated by Bio-Rad. To read this format, add this
  plugin \footnote{\url{http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/plugins/biorad.html}} to
  ImageJ. The file contains z-series of images as a stack. The width, height and
  number of images are extracted from the first three 16-bit word in the 76-byte
  header. The spatial calibration is extracted from the ASCII 'notes' at the end
  of the file (Image/Show Info)
